# lms-neural-network
This repository contains the implementation of a single-layer neural network using the Least Mean Squares (LMS) algorithm. The LMS algorithm is used for training the network to minimize the error between the predicted and actual outputs. It's a simple yet effective approach for linear classification problems.
